## Overview

The `grd0-infrastructure` repository offers a Docker Compose-based setup for deploying the core services of grd0.net.

For the original GitLab repository, visit: [grd0.net GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/grd0.net/grd0-infrastructure)

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the infrastructure, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (version 20.10 or later)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29 or later)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maybeken/grd0-infrastructure.git
   cd grd0-infrastructure
   ```


2. **Start the Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```


   This command will start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode.

3. **Access the Services**

  Please setup the port forwarding accordingly for local deployment.

4. **Stop the Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```


   This command will stop and remove all the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Components

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the following services:

- **grd0-site**: The main website for grd0.net.
- **hoarder-app**: An application for managing and organizing data.
- **nextcloud**: A self-hosted cloud storage solution.
- **vaultwarden**: A lightweight Bitwarden-compatible password manager.
